# TestOS - an MinimalOS styled code made by timon4ikru, a Russian student of 7th grade

Hello there! When I was 10 years old, I wanted to create my own OS. 
And today, my wish became true! I'm ready to present my DevTest versions of my first... OS?
Well, I don't know how to name it because it's NOT an OS. It's a Python code that used to be an OS. 
Now it only has Russian language, but later, the English versions will be deployed. If you want, you can help me with translation by taking my files and translating them to English language.
By the way, you can create not only english version, if you know other languages, you can translate to them too.
And, if you want so, you can create distributives of this... "OS". Like in Linux. 
Btw, if you make some distributives/translations, publish them with #TestOS_Help hashtag.

P.S. all 5 versions were made in one day, 25th of July.
P.P.S. 0.0.1 - 0.0.9 is DevTest. 
       0.1.0 - 0.4.9 will be Alpha.
       0.5.0 - 0.9.9 will be Beta.
       1.0.0+ will be Main OS.
       1.0.0+ with letters (e.g. 1.0.0a) wil be Test Versions.
